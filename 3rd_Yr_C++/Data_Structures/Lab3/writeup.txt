Lab 3 Write Up - Hash Functions

  Quadratic Probing:
    With this method, you check if the bucket returned by the hash function is full.
    If it is, then you will check a bucket that is 1 spot away. Then 4 spots.
    Then 9 spots, and so on for bucket = x^2.

  Double Hashing:
    The difference here is that instead of trying to find the next available spot,
    a second hash function is deployed and then added to the first result to find
    a new bucket.

  Observations:
    With Quadratic Probing, there seems to be potential to skip over buckets that
    could be empty without ever accessing them. With Double Hashing, however,
    given enough time, the program would look through every bucket. Therefore,
    Double Hashing seems like the better option since you wouldn't have as much
    clustering and able to handle higher load factors.
