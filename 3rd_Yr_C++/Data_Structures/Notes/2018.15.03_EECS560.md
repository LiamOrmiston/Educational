## MinMaxHeap

Min heap
- Every node is smaller than the values below it
	- That means that every node is the Min node to the values below

Max heap: 
- Every node is larger than the values below it
	- That means that every node is the Max node to the values below

Min Node:
- A node such that all values below are greater than the Min node
Max Node:
- A node such that all values below are smaller than the Max node

Min Level: 
- A level of a tree that only contains min nodes
Max level:
- A level of a tree that only contains max nodes
----------
**MinMaxHeap:**
- Complete BT
- Levels are alternating between min and max levels
- Root is at a min level 

*Possibilties*
1. x = p(x): check!
2. x < p(x): compare x with min node(s) along the path from x to the root.
3. x > p(x): similar to 2.

s= {17, 20, 5, 8, 12, 11, 37, 46, 8, 9, 1, 1, 18}

To find the parent: A[floor(i/2)]

**deleteMin() when |H| >= 4**
1. remove the root => minMaxheap with a hole at the root
2. Find S, the 2nd smallest element in H.
3. Find last element, X, in H
4. Compare X w/ S
	1. X <= S --> replace root with X.
	2. X > S --> remove S and let S the new root of H
	3. remove X
		1. S is a child of the root --> put X where S was
		2. S is a grandchild of the root --> compare X with the parent of S p(S)
			1. X > p(S) --> remove p(S) (new hole), and patch new hole with X, and use p(S) to patch up the hole vacated by S
			2. X <= p(S) --> use X to patch up the hold caused by S.


----------
**Pseudo Code**

    if(height >= 4) {
		remove(root);
		let S = second smallest element in H;
		let X = last element in H;
		if(X<=S) {
			replace root with X (root = X);
		}
		else { 
			remove S; 
			root = S;
		}
		remove(X);
		if(S->isChild(root)) {
			Put X where S was ... (S = X) 
		}
		if(S->isGrandChild(root)) {
			if(X>S->getParentPtr()->getValue()){
				remove S->getParentPtr()
				S->getParentPtr()= X
				S = S->getParentPtr()
			}
			else {
				S = X;
			}
		}
	}

## More Examples
S={7, 5, 11, 42, 88, 11, 11, 9, 9, 1, 13, 31}

7 
7-->5 
5-->7,11 
5-->7,11-->42 
5-->42,11-->7,88 
5-->88,11-->7,42,11,11-->9,9,1 
1-->88,31-->7,5,11,11-->9,9,42,13,11

**deleteMin()**

delete:1
S = 5
X = 11

5-->88,31-->7,(hole),11,11-->9,9,42,13,(deleted)
5-->88,31-->7,(hole),11,11-->9,9,42,13

compare 11 with 88
11 will try to be inserted
new S = 13
compare 11 with 13
since 11 < 13, 11 fills hole

5-->88,31-->7,11,11,11-->9,9,42,13

**deleteMin()**

delete: 5
S = 7
X = 13

7-->88,31-->(hole),11,11,11-->9,9,42,(deleted)

compare 13 with 88 
13 will try to fill hole
new S = 9
compare 13 with 9
since 13 > 9, 9 fills hole

7-->88,31-->9,11,11,11-->9,42

**deleteMax()**

delete: 88 (max is always a child of the root)
S = 42
X = 9

7-->(hole),31-->9,11,11,11-->9,(deleted)
compare 42 with 9 
42 will try to fill hole
new S = 11
compare 42 with 11
since 42 > 11, 42 fills hole

7-->42,31-->9,11,11,11-->9
